# ThirdPersonGame

## Purpose
I created this repository for learning the **Unreal Engine** and its **C++** and **Blueprint** Visual Scripting **API**.

I do **not** consider this demo **finished**! 

It is just a sandbox for exploring the features of the Unreal Engine and I will add more functionality and assets to this demo in future.

## Contents
It contains an implementation of the 'ThirdPersonGame' game as described in the Unreal Engine video tutorial series **Blueprint 3rd Person Game**
[here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1ga0IoRrpI4xkX4qmCrhGu56/hRO82u1phyw).

I added the **ThirdPerson_FBX** asset from the **wiki page of unrealenging** as described in 
[here](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/File:ThirdPerson_FBX.zip).

## Installation
Just clone this repository from 
https://github.com/martinjanfischer/ThirdPersonGame.git
open the Unreal project file and build it. 

## Requirements
The game was created in **Unreal** version **4.18.3** and Microsoft **Visual Studio 2015** Community.

## Usage
To play the game, use **WASD** to move and **C** to collect batteries.
